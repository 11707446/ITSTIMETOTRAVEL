The view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is widely regarded as an iconic image of Sydney, and of Australia itself. The bridge is nicknamed \"The Coathanger\" because of its arch-based design.\n\n" +
                "The iconic bridge took eight years to build using 53,000 tonnes of steel and six-million hand-driven rivets. During construction, the two steel halves of the towering arch met in the middle of the span on 19 August 1930 at 10pm. Other fascinating facts about the famous Australian bridge include:\n\n" +
                "The bridge walk is on the eastern side. Youâ€™ll find the stairs up to the bridge walk next to the pedestrian crossing near the Australian Heritage Hotel, on Cumberland Street in the historic Rocks. Along the walk is the south-eastern Pylon Lookout, which offers a spectacular panorama.");
